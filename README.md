# ICB-validation
Validation set for the Iridium-catalyzed borylation.

# Details
The validation set includes structures from the AstraZeneca database that are already publicly available.
We queried the database for structures with at least two different substituted aromatic rings that have more than two possible C-H positions.
We checked the literature for those structures and no Iridium-catalyzed borylation studies were available for thos compounds.
Furthermore, we created a survey which could be answered by chemists (either experts or not) to create a human baseline for this reaction type.
We share the anonymised data in ``baseline`` together with the pictures as given in the survey.
